# NOTICE: LEGACY PROJECT
This project is considered "legacy code". The code was written a long time ago and may be subject to code rot.
Disclaimer: The coding style used in this project most likely does not represent my current coding style or methodologies. A legacy repository is kept so long as it has stars/forks, so that other users can continue to view the code.
